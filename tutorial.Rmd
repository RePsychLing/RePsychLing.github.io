* [CheatSheet](https://juliadocs.github.io/Julia-Cheat-Sheet/)
* [Punctuation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/punctuation/): brief documentation for mathematical symbols & functions
* Shift-cmd-P in VSCode to get command list

* To get greek letters, install the latex-input extension in VSCode
    - Click on the Extensions tab in the left column (looks like window panes)
    - Search for `latex-input` and click the install button
    - Now you can type, e.g., `\beta` and tab to get $\beta$
    - Type, e.g., `\_1` (tab) to get subscripts
* In the julia REPL:
    - `]` to access pkg
    - `;` to access the shell
    - `?` to access help
    - `$` to access R (if using RCall)
    - backspace to get back to julia
    - cmd-K to clear the REPL
